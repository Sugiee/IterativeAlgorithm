# IterativeAlgorithm

An iterative numerical process repeats a calculation process until the error is sufficiently small. Ideally, the error reduces as the iterations proceed and the algorithm works as intended. Not all equations and numerical processes iterate towards zero, this allows monitoring of the iterations and allows termination of the iterations prematurely. Uses templating and OOP.

User can change 'INPUT_DATA_ARRAY' and 'maximumError' on line 73-75, to get respective iterations.
